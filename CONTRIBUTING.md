# Contributing to Muso Dojo Next

**This project is developed in the open, but we do not accept outside contributions or Pull Requests at this time.**

We appreciate your interest in the project! However, Muso Dojo Next is currently developed exclusively by its core maintainers. Our roadmap and architecture are evolving rapidly, and managing external contributions would slow down development at this stage.

If you find a bug or have a suggestion, you are welcome to open an issue, but please note that we do not merge pull requests from the community.
